# Detect-Rectangle
This fun program was inspired by Welch Labs's series "Learning to See." I made it to detect if an image drawn is a rectangle or not. It checks for four vertices by converting the image colors into 0's and 1's and comparing the sequences. As expected, this doesn't perform well outside of training data, as it's simple to manipulate four vertices on a non-rectangular shape.

This program was solely a side project for fun, so no full documentation will be provided.
